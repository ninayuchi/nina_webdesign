				<strong>Resting elevation</strong><br>
				All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting elevation as soon as possible.<br>
				Desktop resting elevation is 2dp below the listed values to accommodate mouse and non-touch environments.</div>

			<div class="caption2">
				<strong>Shadows</strong><br>
				Shadows provide important visual cues about objects’ depth and directional movement. They are the only visual cue indicating the amount of separation between surfaces. An object’s elevation determines the appearance of its shadow.<br>
				In motion, shadows provide useful cues about an object’s direction of movement and whether the distance between surfaces is increasing or decreasing.

			<div class="caption3">
				<strong>Object Hierachy</strong><br>
				How you organize objects, or collections of objects, in an app determines how they move in relation to one another. Objects can move independently of each other or be constrained by objects higher in the hierarchy.
