				<p>Nina Ment is a small business founded in 2018 consisting of co-founders Nina Yuchi and Nina Yuchi, website developer Nina Yuchi, marketing director Nina Yuchi, and creative director Nina Yuchi.</p>
				<p>Our goal is to spread the principles of the three R's-- reuse, reduce, and recycle. By purchasing an artisan gift from Nina Ment, you show your support for conservation of the environment and opposition against that one concept created by the Chinese government. Also by purchasing from Nina Ment, you support small online businesses just comprised of employees who are just trying to pay their tuition.</p>
				<p>Browse our hand-picked selection of novelties, accessories, and trinkets that are perfect for gifts, decoration, and more!</p>
				<p>We also strive to provide the best quality products for you to enjoy and assure to you that our items are 100% cruelty-free, GMO- and paraben-free, and locally sourced. Details on our manufacturers will be released soon, so please look forward to that.</p>
				<p>If you would like to be involved in the Nina Ment team, shoot us an email or give us a call! All contact information can be found <a class="contact-link" href="contact.html">here.</a></p>
